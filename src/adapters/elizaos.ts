/**
 * ElizaOS adapter — built on `Action.validate`.
 *
 * `Action.validate` is already a pre-execution gate: the runtime calls it with
 * the same `(runtime, message, state, options)` triple the handler receives and
 * admits the action to the eligible set only when it returns truthy. Composing
 * the guard into `validate` therefore stops the handler from ever running — see
 * `docs/integration-hooks.md` §2 for the source-pinned signatures and the three
 * call sites that enforce it.
 *
 * Wrapping `handler` instead would be weaker: by the time a handler runs, the
 * runtime has already committed to executing the action, and an error thrown
 * there is a failure rather than a refusal.
 *
 * Written structurally, so `@elizaos/core` is not a dependency of this SDK.
 *
 * ### Undetermined handling
 *
 * The guard fails closed. An `undetermined` verdict is not a pass: the
 * validator returns `false` and the action is dropped from the eligible set,
 * exactly as for a `blocked` verdict. The difference between the two is
 * observable through `onDecision` (and `onBlocked`, which is called for both),
 * not through the return value. This is the documented contract the shared
 * verdict-fixture harness asserts against.
 * Options are validated at construction time (see `src/adapters/validate.ts`):
 * a misconfigured adapter throws `AdapterConfigError` before any action runs,
 * rather than failing mid-loop on the first tool call.
