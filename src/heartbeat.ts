/**
 * `startHeartbeat()` — keep a guard's dead-man switch alive.
 *
 * Every long-running agent must send a `heartbeat()` inside the policy's grace
 * window or the account self-freezes. Doing that with an ad-hoc
 * `setTimeout` loop gets the failure modes wrong: an event-loop stall silently
 * skips a beat, a transient RPC failure becomes an unhandled rejection, and
 * nothing reports that a beat was late until the account freezes.
 *
 * This module is the SDK-side primitive: a drift-aware scheduler that fires a
 * heartbeat on an interval, reports lateness instead of swallowing it, routes
 * every rejection to a callback, and stops cleanly (including mid-flight).
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * The client-side skip is a courtesy, not the guarantee: the contract also
 * deduplicates heartbeats within a ledger/grace rule. This scheduler skips a
 * beat that falls in the same wall-clock second as the previous accepted beat,
 * which saves a redundant round trip; it never claims to be the enforcement.
