/**
 * Telemetry for the guard contract's events.
 *
 * The listener consumes **two** streams (plus an opt-in third, added in #58),
 * and this is the part that is easy to get wrong: a blocked decision never
 * reaches the ledger. The guard returns `Err`, which rolls the event back, so
 * a listener that only tails committed ledger events sees a contract that
 * appears to approve everything. The streams are:
 *
 *   1. **ledger events** — `server.getEvents`, filtered to the guard contract.
 *      Carries allowed decisions, heartbeats, and the admin lifecycle events.
 *   2. **simulation diagnostics** — attached to a failed *enforced simulation*.
 *      Carries blocked decisions, which by construction have no transaction.
 *   3. **failed-transaction diagnostics** (opt-in, `failedTx` option) —
 *      attached to a transaction that *was* broadcast, included in a ledger,
 *      and then failed on-chain. Its events roll back exactly like a blocked
 *      simulation's, but the RPC preserves them on the `getTransaction` /
 *      `getTransactions` response (`diagnosticEventsXdr`, public and typed in
 *      the pinned stellar-sdk 17.0.1 — see docs/event-schema.md for the spike
 *      evidence).
 *
 * The topic vocabulary is the one verified against the live chain in
 * `docs/event-schema.md`, not the one the contracts documentation describes.
 *
 * ## Stable ids (issue #33)
 *
 * Every decoded `GuardEvent` carries a non-null, stable `id`, because the two
 * streams fail identity in opposite ways: a committed event is anchored on a
 * transaction hash, while a blocked one has no ledger anchor at all (it was
 * rolled back before broadcast) and needs a synthetic id derived from its own
 * content. The format and the collision notes are documented in
 * `docs/event-schema.md` and implemented by `guardEventId` below.

 *   to the committed frontier already drained, not a ledger. That is the rule a
 *   consumer relies on: a decision observed at time T appears after the
 *   committed events drained at or before T.
 *
 * ## De-duplication rule
 *
 * `GuardEvent.id` is the SDK's delivery key, and the merge emits each id **at
 * most once** — first observation wins. A guard decision is single-homed (a
 * blocked decision is rolled back and never committed; an allowed decision has
 * no diagnostic), so the same decision cannot arrive under two ids. The
 * duplicate the merge actually guards against is the *same id* delivered twice

   * `signal` ending the stream is a normal exit, never a throw: an abort before

   * one bound on promptness is the request already in flight: `getEvents` takes
   * no `AbortSignal` (see the README's cancellation note), so the listener can
   * stop *issuing* requests immediately but cannot cancel one already sent.
   *
   * ## Concurrency
   *
   * One listener supports one active stream. Starting a second `watch()` or
   * `watchAll()` while the first is still being pulled throws
   * `ConcurrentTelemetryStreamError`; it never issues an RPC request, saves a
   * cursor, or records an event. Use a separate listener for an independent
